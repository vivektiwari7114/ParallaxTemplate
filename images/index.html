								<br />
								Prof. Tambe has contributed several foundational papers in agents and multiagent systems and computational game theory; three main areas are <a href="http://teamcore.usc.edu/pubDetails.aspx?id=415" target = "_blank"> MULTIAGENT TEAMWORK</a>, 
								<a href="http://teamcore.usc.edu/pubDetails.aspx?id=315" target = "_blank">DISTRIBUTED CONSTRAINT OPTIMIZATION (DCOP)</a> and

								For this research, he has received the influential paper award and best paper awards
								at a number of premier Artificial Intelligence Conferences and workshops --- these have
								included International Joint Conference on AI (IJCAI), International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS) and 
								International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA) (e.g., recent best paper awards include AAMAS'2016, IAAI'2016, IJCAI'15, AAMAS'12,
								AAMAS'11, IVA'11, AAMAS'09). Furthermore,
								today, the security games framework that Prof. Tambe pioneered has been deployed and tested
								for security optimization, both nationally and internationally, by agencies such as the US Coast Guard and the Federal Air Marshals Service,
								by various police departments in Los Angeles, as well as by non-governmental organizations committed to wildlife conservation. 
								 This research has led him and his students to receive the US Coast Guard Meritorious Team  Commendation from the Commandant(2013), 
								US Coast Guard First District's Operational Excellence Award(2011),  Certificate of Appreciation from the US
								Federal Air Marshals Service (2011) and special commendation given by the Los Angeles World Airports
								police  from the city of Los Angeles(2009). Finally, his work with algorithms for exploiting social networks for HIV prevention
                                                                were listed by Mashable.com in their <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/12/20/social-good-innovations-2015/" target = "_blank">"26 incredible innovations that improved the world in 2015"</a>.
